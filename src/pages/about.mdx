## Commitment to Diversity & Inclusion

oSTEM strives to provide a safe space for all people to express themselves. To
that end, we have and hold ourselves to a high-level and broad diversity policy,
built around respect for individuals regardless of where they are on life’s
journey. oSTEM prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender, sex, gender
identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, race, color, ethnicity,
citizenship, cultural background, socioeconomic status, age, disability,
religion, or veteran status. Furthermore, oSTEM prohibits any harassment that
detracts from the learning experience or threatens an individual in any form.

## History of oSTEM

In October 2005, IBM sponsored a focus group where students convened at the
Human Rights Campaign headquarters in Washington D.C. as part of the Out for
Work conference. These students discussed topics relevant to LGBTQ+ communities
at their own colleges and universities and debated how to form an organization
that serves students in the STEM community.

oSTEM emerged from that meeting as a new national technical student society for
LGBT communities.

Before oSTEM, there was no inclusive organization dedicated to serving LGBTQ+
students in STEM, though other organizations had celebrated and supported
diversity in science and engineering through other professional societies, such
as Society of Women Engineers (SWE), Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers
(SHPE), National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), Society of Asian Scientists
and Engineers (SASE), American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES),
and others.

In order to advance LGBTQ+ STEM students, five chapters collaborated to found
oSTEM Inc. in 2009 with 501(c)(3) status by December 2010. In 2017, oSTEM, Inc.
expanded its mission to be inclusive of professionals, serving all LGBTQ+ people
in the STEM community.
