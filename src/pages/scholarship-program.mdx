# Scholarship Program

We are excited to announce the establishment of the oSTEM Scholarship Program! For the 2021 scholarship cycle, we have 11 Scholarships that members of the LGBTQ+ STEM community can apply for.

### How does it work?

Our general application can be used to apply to any (and multiple) of the scholarships that we offer. Additionally, you can opt into the community funded scholarships through this same form. We've included a downloadable PDF of the criteria which will be used to score the applications as well as a PDF of the questions on the application form.

### What are the requirements to apply for the scholarships?

Below you can find the requirements for the scholarships available. While being an oSTEM member isn't required, we would obviously love anyone who applies to join our organization. You can register for free [here](https://ostem.org/form/register/).

* Students attending community college, undergraduate, or graduate institutions are eligible to apply
* Applicants must be pursuing a degree in a STEM field
* Applicants must have completed at least one semester at their institution
* The institution must be based in the USA
* Applicants must identify as a member of the LGBTQ+ community
* Applicants must be able to be recognized as an awardee at the annual oSTEM Conference

Please note that GPA is **not** a requirement or a criteria.

To help you prepare for your application, you can preview the application questions and read through prompts to help jump start your personal statement. You can also view the criteria that we will be using to score the applications.
