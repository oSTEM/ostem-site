# LGBTQ Crisis Hotlines and Services

oSTEM is committed to supporting all of our members across all spectrums of
diversity. We recognize that our LGBTQIA+ community faces mental health
conditions just like the rest of the population. However, LGBTQIA+ people may
experience more negative mental health outcomes due to prejudice and other
biases.

mental health crises. If you are not in an acute crisis, but are dealing with
